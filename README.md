# PG-GANs-for-synthetic-data-generation
Progressive Growing GAN is an extension to the GAN training process that allows for the stable training of generator models that can output large high-quality images. ... Progressive growing GAN models are capable of generating photorealistic synthetic faces and objects at high resolution that are remarkably realistic.

We will be using PG GANs for generating high quality synthetic data for improving the accuracy of the ML model 

Results 
Synthetic data generated by using MRI scans
